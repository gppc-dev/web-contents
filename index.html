          <h2>The Competition</h2>
          <p>Computing paths for moving agents is a core challenge in many application areas, such as robotics and computer games. 
            Grid-based models offer a simple and effective way to tackle this problem, with many new works appearing throughout the 
            academic literature. Research in this area is most often motivated by practical considerations, and the resulting algorithmic 
            techniques usually come with tradeoffs, such as solution quality vs. runtime performance vs. compute resource costs 
            (CPU, memory etc.). The Grid-Based Path Planning Competition (GPPC<sup>2</sup>) is a forum for tracking and disseminating state-of-the-art 
            progress in the area. It is the fourth edition of the competition, with previous <a href="https://movingai.com/GPPC/">competitions in 2012, 2013 and 2014</a>.</p>
          <p>
            The goals of the competition are: 
            <ul>
              <li>To identify important topics in Grid-based Path Planning and to establish clear baselines for state-of-the-art performance.</li>
              <li>To promote best practice for experimental evaluation, including suitable metrics, analysis methods and benchmarking techniques.</li>
              <li>To disseminate results to the broader community and track progress over time.</li>
              <li>To promote and grow research in the area of Grid-based Path Planning.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We invite submissions from established researchers, active practitioners and interested students. Participation in the competition 
            can help to grow confidence in the practical suitability of existing (in-production) methods or in newly proposed algorithmic techniques.

          <h2>Competition Setup</h2>
          <p>GPPC<sup>2</sup> currently measures progress in two distinct tracks:
            <ul>
              <li>Classical track, which is 8-connected pathfinding on a static grid map
              </li>
              <li>
                Any-angle track, where grid paths are not restricted to eight directions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Both tracks run continuously and submissions are welcome at any time. Participants can submit multiple times and their submission will be evaluated automatically. Results are available in real-time and progress in the competition is indicated using a live leaderboard. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On an annual basis a snapshot of results will be taken and used to create a report. This report will summarise the advances made through the year and the current state of the art. A summary of these results will be presented at the next edition of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS).

          <h2>How to Participate</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Login with your Github account.</li>
            <li>Download the start kit for the <a href="https://github.com/gppc-dev/startkit/tree/master">classic</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gppc-dev/startkit/tree/anyangle">anyangle</a> track.</li>
            <li>Read the submission instructions and integrate your solving technique.</li>
            <li>Submit your first entry!</li>
            <li>Track your progress via the leaderboard!</li>

          <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>All GPPC<sup>2</sup> submissions are evaluated using a standard benchmark problem set. These problems comprise grid maps and 
            pathfinding instances that are drawn from real applications and/or which are synthetically generated.</p>
          <p>The evaluation process is threefold: (i) (optional) offline preprocessing, where auxiliary data can be generated; 
            (ii) offline validation, which checks that every test problem can be successfully solved and; (iii) online evaluation, where 
            algorithmic performance is measured according to several distinct metrics (see our website for the full details). A submission 
            is considered successful if it passes validation and solves every problem during evaluation.</p>

          <h2>Ranking and Results</h2>
          <p>
            In GPPC<sup>2</sup> there is no single winner but a pareto-frontier of undominated entries. 
            This approach reflects the many distinct settings where Grid-based Path Planning is applied, 
            and where performance is often regarded from different perspectives. 
          </p>
            Authors of successful submissions, which are undominated for any period during a given year, 
            will be invited to co-author the annual report. The report will appear in the archival proceedings 
            of the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS).
