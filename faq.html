                <h3>How will my submission be evaluated?</h3>
                <p>Evaluation servers will clone the submitted code, build docker containers using an Ubuntu docker image, and install packages listed in "apt.txt" 
                    using apt-get. Please make sure the packages listed in apt.txt are available for apt-get on Ubuntu 20.04. </p>
                <p>We use a modified Ubuntu 20.04 image, with make, cmake, build-essential and libboost-all-dev packages installed on default. 
                    You can use an example Dockerfile in the start-kit to build a docker image and test your implementation in a docker container.
                </p>
                <p>Evaluation servers will compile the submitted code in docker containers using the "compile.sh".</p>
                <p>The evaluation involves three steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preprocessing: If the implementation support preprocessing map data, we run the submitted program with the "-pre" flag for all the benchmark maps. All preprocessing data should be stored in index_data/ of the current working directory. 
                        These data will be accessible in validation and benchmark steps.</li>
                    <li>Validation: In this step, we run the submitted program with the "-check" flag, and validate the correctness of outputs.</li>
                    <li>Benchmark: In this step, we run the submitted program with the "-run" flag, and measure the performance of the submitted program.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The benchmark step guarantees that only one program is running on one computer.</p>
                <p>Please note, we will manually review the code when drafting the annual report to prevent any potential violation of fairness.</p>
            <h3>What are the evaluation parameters?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The evaluation server gives one CPU to the submitted program. </li>
                <li>If the program support multi-thread preprocessing, we give 4 CPUs for preprocessing.</li>
                <li>The preprocessing runtime is limited to 3 days per map, as some large benchmark maps may be time-consuming for preprocessing.</li>
                <li>The validation and benchmark runtime is limited to 4 hours per map. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do I test my implementation.</h3>
                <p>You can use any <a href="https://movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html">Moving AI benchmark instances</a> 
		and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/benchmarks/src/master/">Iron-Harvest benchmark instances</a> to test your implementation.</p>
		<p>A solution validator is implemented in start-kit, which checks your output when running with flag "-check".</p>
            <h3>How many submissions are allowed?</h3>
                <p>You can submit as many as you want, but only one submission can be evaluated at the same time.</p>
            <h3>Can I submit as part of a team?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can. We will collect team information from participants.</p>
            <h3>My submission failed evaluation, what should I do now?</h3>
                <P>Read the error message and progress log in submission history. 
                    Try to debug your program locally on the same map.

        <h3>How to update the startkit?</h3>
            <p>Updating the startkit involves pulling the immutable files from the respective tracks.  The mutable file Entry.cpp has also been update to bring in line with minor changes to function signature, but must be handled manually.</p>
            <p>Included in update is pulling update LICENSE file, the repo license has not changed, just updated license holder information.</p>
